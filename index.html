           <p>At home drawing pictures of mountain tops <br>
            With him on top<br>
            Lemon yellows sun arms raised in a V<br>
            Dead lay in pools of maroon below</p>
            <p>Daddy didn't give attention <br>
            To the fact that Mommy didn't care<br>
            King Jeremy the wicked rules his world</p>
            <p>Jeremy spoke in class today<br>
            Jeremy spoke in class today</p>
            <p>Clearly I remember picking on the boy<br>
            Seemed a harmless little fuck<br>
            But we unleashed a lion<br>
            Gnashed his teeth and bit the recessed lady's<br>
            breast</p>
            <p>How could I forget<br>
            He hit me a surprise left<br>
            My jaw left hurtin', dropped wide open<br>
            Just like the day, like the day I heard</p>
