           <p>At home drawing pictures of mountain tops
            With him on top
            Lemon yellows sun arms raised in a V
            Dead lay in pools of maroon below</p>
            <p>Daddy didn't give attention
            To the fact that Mommy didn't care
            King Jeremy the wicked rules his world</p>
            <p>Jeremy spoke in class today
            Jeremy spoke in class today</p>
            <p>Clearly I remember picking on the boy
            Seemed a harmless little fuck
            But we unleashed a lion
            Gnashed his teeth and bit the recessed lady's
            breast</p>
            <p>How could I forget
            He hit me a surprise left
            My jaw left hurtin', dropped wide open
            Just like the day, like the day I heard</p>
